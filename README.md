# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation for this project was to create a simplified all in one guide to assist with understanding and implementing newly acquired skills. This guide allows me to find all the necessary information I need in one convenient place. I have learned the baiscs of how and why coding is used. This project allowed me to gain a deeper understading of how the behind the scenes of a website works, and how it is put together in pieces.
